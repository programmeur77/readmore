# readmore
This read more "plugin" was created in HTML/CSS and jQuery. The principle is simple. Let's say a user is adding a long comment under a publication. For layout and UX reasons, it's impossible to show the entire comment. So this plugin add a dynamic read more link to show the entire comment if some users would like to see it.
